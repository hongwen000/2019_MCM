## Background 

The menace posed by terrorists has skyrocketed over the past decade, especially with the rise of ISIS.  The number of terrorist incidents has increased since 2010, along with the number of fatalities, both reaching peaks in 2014. That year, the world suffered from 16903 terrorist attacks and 44490 deaths.(our world in data) Amongst regions attacked by terrorism, Europe has been facing the greatest challenges, in which France is the critical target. From the major terrorist attack in Bataclan concert hall in November 2015 to Christmas market attack in Strasbourg in 2018, France has witnessed a dramatic increase in terrorist activities since 2014.

Normally, terrorists tend to launch attacks in tourist spots with large crowds. As one of the world's largest and most visited sites, the Lourve underwent a terrorist threat in 2017. During the attack, most visitors were instructed to stay still in the Lourve even after the perpetrator was caught.() It is obvious that the current emergency plans cannot solve the new arising terrorist issues. Hence, to evacuate the visitors quickly and safely, an adaptable evacuation plan necessitates a thorough reconsideration. 

Meanwhile, an upgraded emergency plan should consider practical conditions and scrutinize any bottlenecks when it comes to implementation. While the emergency evacuation plan is tailored for the Lourve, it can still apply to other large and crowded mega-buildings which under potential threats with a little adjustment.

##Our Work 

Inspired by game theory, we design our own game theory model based on the shortest time for evacuation. Since individuals are rational, they may endeavor to leave the hazardous area as quickly as possible. In this model, we will calculate when evacueesâ€™ behavioral reactions along with their movement and the capacity of all the routines reach a Nash equilibrium so that individual optimum strategy can be achieved and the shortest time evacuees use to leave the hazardous area can be unfolded. But this model has some limitations in terms of application scope, so we will introduce one more metric to solve the problem.

After elaborating reasonable metrics on optimization models, we devise an evacuation time optimization model based on network flow. This model will give the answers of how can evacuees as a whole evacuate as fast as possible and how many time spent. 

Additionally, we improve our evacuation time optimization model with some adjustment  so as to extend its applicability on diverse situations

Lastly, we analyze the sensitivity and scalability of our models and discuss their merits and demerits.
