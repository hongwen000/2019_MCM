## Fundamental Assumptions 

- **Each evacuee is rational during the interactive decision-making process.** That is to say, their behaviors will be based on the observed situation and logical reasoning and they will pursue solutions that meet their interest rationally.

- **Evacuee will endeavor to leave the hazardous area as quickly as possible.** We assume that  all the evacuees are selfish during an emergency so they need to compete with each other to gain the greatest chance to flee.

- **The reaction time for the emergency and the fleeing time to egress sequence are neglected.** Because both time mentioned above are short enough to overlook

- **Visitors are assumed to flock in dense area with well-known displays.** That is to say, evacuees start from the same node when emergency happens

- **Evacuees will be under the command of emergency personnel.** Based on the information provided by the problem, the majority visitors of the Lourve are visiting for the first time. So it is reasonable to assume that the visitors will follow the command of emergency personnel due to their low familiarity with the building.

- **during emergency, the moving direction of all staircases will be altered towards emergency egress.** In other words, evacuees have no difficulty in using staircases to leave the building.

- **Once emergency emerges, all the closed exibition rooms will be open.** Emergency personnel of each floor are trained to react to emergency so they will open all the passageways to ensure free flow.

- **There are no obstacles to evacuation in aisles.**

- 

-  Given those preconditions, we can set out to construct our model so as to figure out a safe and efficient evacuation plan for the Louvre.
