## 11 Model Evaluation

### 11.1 Evaluation on the game theory based model

#### Strengths

1.For this model, there are two obvious strengths that we insist. Firstly, this model is based on simulated method and authentic data to acheive relatively reliable simulation outcome. 2.Secondly, Nash Equilibrium allows individuals to attain the optimum choice on their own. Due to selfishness, it is feasible for people to accept the calculated results.

#### Weakness

1.It should also be noticed that, there are few problems with this model. First of all, this model assumes that everybody are totally aware of the others' choices. However, in the actual scenes of evacuation, an individual is only aware of nearby ones' evacuation choice. Moreover, people are impossible to realize every evacuation path. 

2.Additionally, even though this model gives an optimal choice for every individual, it will by no mean affect overall evacuation speed. In this way, this model is not suitable for instructing people getting out of the Louvre safely and efficiently. In other words, some people will be left behind with an extremely long evacuation time.

### 11.2 Evaluation on the optimized evacuation time model

#### Strengths

1.The optimized evacuation time model based on network flow, aims to develop the optimum solution for the whole situation. Taking the previous model as comparison.

2.The optimized evacuation time model has geat scalability, which can be applied to complex situations under various restrictions. It can perfectly fit in with the restrictions given by the problem, providing reasonable path for disabled people and foreign visitors.

#### Weakness

The transparent weakness of this model is that, it assumes each individual definitely obey any command. However, it is unrealistic in the application, since people all tend to speculative choices.
