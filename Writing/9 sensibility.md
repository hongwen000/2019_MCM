## 9 Sensibility

### 9.1 Cutting Off Segments

There are several potential threats due to the safety coefficient of evacuation paths. For instance, the breakage of stairs or fire caused by the attack may block out some available exits because of low safety factor. To test the feasibility of our model under these situations, we delete some edges to require a chart as below.

(表格)

Information shown in the chart indicates that our model is firm enough to hold back the variation. / our model reacts sensibly to the variation. (后面加上 future work )

### 9.2 Visiting Peak

Another variation is that the evacuation plan may be affected by the amount of visitors, especially at peak tourist seasons.  High loads of visitors not only endanger the capacity of stairs and elevators, but also post a threat on the efficiency of our evacuation model.
