	\subsection{Model Analysis}
			\subsubsection{Representation of The Louvre}
	
			We use an undirected graph $G(V,E)$ to model the architectural structure of Louvre. Each node $v_i \in V$ represents a scenic spot, a corner in the Louvre or a crossing point of the passageway. The edge $e_{i,j}$ connects node $v_i$ and $v_j$ means the segment of passageway connecting the two points in the Louvre, which can be a segment of a corridor, a stair or an elevator. We measure the width $w$ and length $l$ of the corridors and stairs $e_{i,j}$ using Google map. We also estimate the capacity of elevators by consulting \ref{} and set the equivalent $w = , e = $.  Figure \ref{fig:subfig_gd} shows the ichnography of the ground floor and its corresponding graph representation. The number on the edge denotes the length.

			Different floors are connected by those edges denoting stairs and elevators. The representations of all five floors are as follows.  The four exits are labeled $2, 19, 34, 46$.

			\subsubsection{Model Description}
			​ In this model, we assign some potential gathering points such as sightseeing sites that initially hold a larger number of people. In order to assess the utility payoff of each participant in different initial points choosing specific egress, we introduce the cost $c_R = \sum\limits_{e \in R} c_e$ of choosing this route $R$, where $c_e$ is the cost of choosing an edge on the route. 
			It is reasonable to assume that:
			
			\begin{itemize}
				\item $c_e$ is negative corelated with the transactional capacity of the edge.
				\item $c_e$ is positive correlated with the length of the edge.
				\item $c_e$ is positive correlated with the number of people on the edge($n_e$),  because the more people choose this route, the more crowded it will be.
		\end{itemize}
			
In practice, we design the formula \ref{for_ce} to calcuate $c_e$.
			\begin{equation}
			c_e = \frac{l_e}{v_e}
						\label{for_ce}
			\end{equation}
			 ,where $v$ is defined by formula \ref{f_vel} and \ref{for_rho}.
			
			\begin{equation}
			v=\left\{
			\begin{aligned}
			&1.4 &  \rho \le 0.75 \\
			&1.867 - 0.59 \rho + 0.0412 \rho^2 &  0.75 < \rho \le 4.2 \\
			&\frac{0.42}{\rho} &  \rho > 4.2
			\end{aligned}
			\right .
			\label{f_vel}
			\end{equation}
			
			\begin{equation}
			\rho = \frac{n}{w*l}
			\label{for_rho}
			\end{equation}
			
		In this way, the game players try to maximize the utility payoff by minimizing the $c$ of the chosen route.
			
		\subsubsection{Model Iteration}
		​       We obtain the average visit per day by calculating the mathematic mean of the previous 4 years’ visits to the Louvre, and subsequently assign the same numbers of people to each gathering point. The second step is to set a random route preference for each participant as a begin point. Because the change of one person’s choice will also change the velocity of a corridor and thus change the utility payoff of others, this process of iteration is a constantly adjusting process. We continue iterating until no one has a better option – no one has a lower cost of getting out by choosing a different route. At this time, we reach a equilibrium where under a complete rationality assumption everyone ceases to alter their choices.
		
		The model above serves as our preliminary model due to its limitation and next step we will introduce another model to solve the problem comprehensively.
	
\subsection{Experiment}

\paragraph{Estimated number of people inside the building}
According to Little's law (formula\ref{for_little}), the long-term average number $L$ of people in a stationary system equals to the long-term average effective arrival rate $\lambda$ multiplied by the average time $W$ that people spend in the system.

\begin{equation}
{L=\lambda*W}
\label{for_little}
\end{equation}

Based on related reports\ref{}, the average people waiting for the Lourve is 3000, which means $\lambda$ is 3000. The average time people spend in visiting is 2 hours. So $L$ is 6000.



\paragraph{Simulation Results}
We implemented the game using C++. After 29 iterations, the Nash equilibrium is achieved. According to the escape route of each escaper at this time, we conducted an escape simulation experiment. We calculate the speed of each person according to the formula \ref{f_vel} and update the location of each person every second. Figure \ref{} shows the results, which the abscissa is the escape time interval, and the ordinate is the number of people who escaped within the interval. 

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

We found that except for some people of the initial locations at the exit, who escape in no time,  most visitors spend more than 2000 seconds to escape the Louvre. The clearance time is 3812, which is the not an optimistic result when a terrorist attack is going on.
