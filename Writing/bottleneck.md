According to some literatures, the network flow transshipment algorithm(1) used in EVACNET+ and SAFE-R considers the bottleneck in evacuation is on the passageway or staircase while a fast flow control algorithm (2)assumes that doors would be the bottleneck in most evacuation cases because the widths of passageways and staircases are wider than egress doors. 



In our model, we determine the bottleneck in the building by examining the smallest flow in the model which calculates the evacuation time of certain evacuees. For example, when….., …the flow is XXX.
