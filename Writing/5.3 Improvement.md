### 5.3 Improvement

Considering the situation that the problem has posted, our evacuation plan aims to guarantee visitors from different coutries or at different ages being efficiently evacuated. To satisfy this goal, we modify our evacuation plan from three aspects.

#### 5.3.1 Evacuations path for people with restricted mobility

Our model aim to serve not only the disabled people but also the elders and obesity individuals. Since those visitors have restricted mobility, their evacuation path should be consider priorily. Our model introduce parallel edges for them. In the parallel edges, infirm and disabled people have lower evacuation speed, occupying seperated flow capacity.

#### 5.3.2 Adding entrances for emergency personnel

Taking the entry of emergency personnel is of practical significance, because when the Louvre is partially damaged, only a small number of emergency personnel is needed to implement rescue operation. As long as there is any people trying to get into the building while visitors all trying to get out, convection happens. In this case, it is relatively easier to coordinate evacuation and emergency rescue. However, as the level of terror attacks continue to deepen, it is more difficult to execute rescue mission, leading to more emergency personnel are needed. When convection aggravates, the difficulty of evacuation deepens. Hence, it is very significant to coordinate the evacuation and the entry of emergency personnel reasonably. Otherwise, defusing convection creates conditions favorable to preserve life safety and those precious relics.

Our model introduces reversed edges to defuse convection. In the bidirection network, reversed edges are arcs with the same capacity of flow but with a opposite direction. Emergency personnel enter the building through these edges to avoid colliding with evacuating visitors. The algorithm using auxiliary source as the super source of emergency personnel. 

To apply our model to solve this problem, we use the method of bidirectional flow control. This control method allows people traveling in opposite directions are gathered in the same edge by creating a theoretical point. Meanwhile , the network flow model can be used to calculate the optimal evacuating time when adding bidirectional edge.

#### 5.3.1 Evacuations involving people using different languages

It can be implied that visitors come from France, Germany, the United States, the U.K., Brazil, Italy, China and other countries. Hence, developing a system which can serve both French citizens and international visitors.

This problem can be solved without changing the algorithm. Using various escape guide and alert can acheive the goal. For example, as the app "Affluences" installed on visitors mobile phones, it can trigger an emergency alert when terror attacks take place. Additionally, using the annunciator set up alongside the corridor, it is possible to give discoverable evacuation signs. The displays in the hall can act as auxiliary function, scrolling to broadcast emergency evacuation information in different languages.
