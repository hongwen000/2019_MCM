Dear sir sheet

Upon hearing that the executive of the Lourve is working on formulating policy and procedure to upgrade emergency management of the Lourve aiming dealing with the non-traditional emergency, my fellow colleagues and I are honored to engage in clearly communicating our role and scope of engagement in the development of emergency evacuation plans. We have been working with painstaking efforts so as to do something for the Lourve concerning precaution of terrorist attacks, and we do have some results by researching day and night these days. We truly hope that we can be of help in providing proposed crowd management recommendations and emergency evacuation procedures for the Lourve to ensure the safety of visitors and the staff.

Inspired by optimization model, we established a smart evacuation model based on network flow that allows visitors to leave the Lourve as quickly and safely as possible (补充）Based on the results of our models, we recommend some feasible policies both on emergency evacuation and the crowd management for your reference.

The policy strategy for emergency evacuation should be based on the risk evaluation of the surrounding environment. Immediate upgrade for emergency plans are necessary on the grounds of that miscellaneous threats will emerge in various ways. Furthermore, safety measures for organizational and architectural construction and digital monitor shall be in balance. The Lourve ought to mark the emergency exits noticeably and reconstruct the ‘secret exits’ for emergency use. Emergency shelters for special people such as the disabled should be taken into consideration due to their restricted mobility. Above all, the staff and emergency personnel are required to execute adaptable plans to respond in an emergency.


In terms of crowd management,  particularly indoor space evacuation, it is necessary to pay attention to the total number of people before the start of evacuation and to properly control the rationalization of the size of the population entering the system. According to game theory, individual always seeks the optimum solution for itself, in other words, the crowd will choose the way that is advantageous to them. Nevertheless, to evacuate efficiently as a whole, one may sacrifice his optimum solution but adhere to the overall optimum solution. As a result, we firmly believe that ground personnel ought to receive professional train to maintain order and control the crowd.

As mentioned previously, the scalability of evacuation time optimization model based on network flow illustrates that the model can be modified and adapted to applications for other large, crowded structures. It is highly recommended that the Lourve keeps liaison and coordination with other museums or buildings in order to exchange experience on emergency evacuation plans. 

Finally, we sincerely suggest that emergency drills are held regularly according to the estimated time and routines for emergency evacuation based on our evacuation time optimization model.
Best regards,

The ICM team
