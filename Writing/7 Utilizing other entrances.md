## 7 Utilizing other entrances

when and how

### 7.1 Entrance for the emergency personnel

Since emergency personnels such as fire fighters, doctors and SWAT, are essential for managing situations after terror attacks. In this way, as terror attacks happen, it is necessary for emergency personnels to get to the scene immediately. 

Meanwhile, visitors' evacuation routes should be taken into consideration. The arriving of emergency personnels cannot obstruct the evacuation path. 

Hence, it is proper to open other entrances for emergency personnel to get into the museum. Together with the discussion of merit and demerit of opening other entrances to the public, a propriate solution will be presented later.

### 7.2 Egress for the visitors

As the problem states, there are others available exits only known to the staff. It is obvious that opening these entrances will make changes to the evacuation plan. We are going to list the benefits and shortages of utilizing these entrances as additional evacuation path.

#### 7.2.1 Benefits

Apparently, opening more exits to the public helps increase the efficiency of evacuation. Precisely, more possible ways for evacuation arrangement, more quickly the visitors can be instructed out of the Louvre.  The improvement of efficiency can be viewed from two aspects.

a. It can help alleviate the burden of evacuation at those famous exhibition halls. For example, the hall displaying *Mona Lisa* is crowded with people all year round. If opening nearby entrances for visitors to evacuate, there will be smaller flow of people rushing out of the main four entrances. In other words, available extra exits benefits the most crowded halls to great extent.

b. In less crowded places, more available exits help instructing people to various path, which will not aggravate the most crowded entrances. Flows from diffferent rooms can avoid colliding with each others, since there are more entrances for people to evacuate.

#### 7.2.2 Shortages

However, there are still abundant shortages when opening more exits to the public. Shortages are listed below, considering maintaining cost, security and other messy results.

a. maintaining cost

As it states in the Problem, those available doors are only known to the staff. Some of which are employee entrances and old secret entrances built by the monarchy. It can be implied that these doors are not suitable for large amounts of visitors to rush out in their original conditions. Hence, maintaining or repairing those available exits cost much budget.

b. lack of security

To secure the precious cultural relic in the museum, the security at the main entrances must be rigour, using various advanced techniques to eliminate danger. However, other doors are not used for regular entry, with no sufficient security. It provides possibility for criminals to enter the building when disorder takes place.If less-secured exits are open to the public, it is definitely that the Louvre will suffer from more risks.

c. messy situations

If opening more exits to the public, there must be certain people being directed to those exits. When they notice that most people are rushing to the main entrances, hesitation and disobedience towards the instruction appear. As a result, this will lead to messy situations, such as collision with each other.

From this aspect, opening more exits do no good to the evacuation instruction.

d. infeasible to open those entrances immediately as soon as emergency happens

It is not feasible to open all those entrances immediately as soon as emergency happens. Because it also takes time for the staff to get to the specific entrances, which is not practical while evacuating.

###  7.3 Appropriate Solution

Since opening exits in addition to the four main entrances has both advantages and disadvantages, it is necessary to discuss the appropriate solution for utilizing those exits. The solution consists of two aspects, when to use and how to use, as described below.

#### 7.3.1 When to use

Mainly considering the shortages those exits cause, we recommend using the exits only for emergency take place. At regular time, those exits are closed for fundamental security.

However, when potential threats such as fire or the attack scenes block out some segments of evacuation path, the alternate exits should be open for evacuation. Meanwhile, it should be noticed that the utilization of the additional exits should match with the level of the emergency, since the safety factor of each kind of doors differs. Specifically, VIP entrances are of high safety factor which are suitable to act as an evacuation exit. Nevertheless, secret entrances built by monarchy are of extremely low safety factor, which means if there is no extra-severe attack happens, these secret entrances shouldn't be open.

#### 7.3.2 How to use

In terms of the number of exits can highly improve the efficiency of the evacuation plan near the famous exhibition halls, the Louvre can utilize those entrances. For example, the hall displaying the *Mona Lisa* or the second floor of the Denon Wing.

Meanwhile, we recommend daily maintaning procedure to insure the safety of those path.

As for the possible messy outcoming, it is feasible to emphaszie that the instruction is the optimal solution for every individual. Only in this way can make sure that the crowd follows evacuation guidance.
