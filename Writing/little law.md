According to Little's law, the long-term average number $L$ of people in a stationary system equals to the long-term average effective arrival rate $\lambda$ multiplied by the average time $W$ that people spend in the system

${L=\lambda*W}$



Based on estimate, the average people waiting for the Lourve is 3000, which means $\lambda$ is 3000. The average time people spend in visiting is 2 hours. So $L$ is 6000.
